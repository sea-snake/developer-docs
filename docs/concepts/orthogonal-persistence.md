<!-- Content Brief -->
Explain orthogonal persistence on ICP. Cover how canister memory (heap) persists between calls, stable memory as the upgrade-safe storage layer, heap persistence in Motoko (automatic with enhanced orthogonal persistence), stable structures in Rust (StableBTreeMap, etc.), and the trade-offs between heap and stable memory. Compare with traditional database-backed backends.
