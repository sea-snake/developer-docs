# Design Decisions Log

Record decisions that constrain future work — things an agent needs to know that aren't obvious from the code. Remove entries that are fully reflected in the current codebase (renames, file moves, cleanup).

---

## 2026-03-11: Diataxis framework with 5 top-level sections
**Context:** Need a clear information architecture for the new developer docs
**Decision:** Use Diataxis with 5 sections: Getting Started (tutorials), Guides (how-to), Concepts (explanations), Languages (synced + hand-written), Reference (information)
**Rationale:** Diataxis is proven, maps cleanly to developer intent ("how do I" vs "what is" vs "exact params"). Languages gets its own section due to volume (52+ synced Motoko pages).
**Alternatives considered:** 10-section structure (too many groups), single guides section (too flat), capabilities as top-level (not a Diataxis quadrant)

## 2026-03-11: No separate capabilities section
**Context:** IC capabilities (chain-key, VetKeys, HTTPS outcalls, timers, randomness) are the platform's biggest differentiators
**Decision:** Keep capabilities in concepts/ (explanation) with companion how-to guides in guides/backends/ (task-oriented)
**Rationale:** A "capabilities" section is marketing-oriented, not Diataxis-aligned. Developers find content by intent: "what is chain-key" → concepts/, "how to make HTTPS outcalls" → guides/backends/
**Alternatives considered:** Top-level capabilities section (violates Diataxis), capabilities under guides only (loses explanatory depth)

## 2026-03-11: Code examples — inline vs link to examples repo
**Context:** Need a consistent strategy for code in docs
**Decision:** Inline code for snippets under ~30 lines. Link to dfinity/examples repo for anything larger. Prefer linking when possible — examples repo has CI, tests, and versioning. Only inline when the `technical-documentation` skill determines it's essential for the page.
**Rationale:** Short snippets aid reading flow. Long examples are better maintained in a dedicated repo with tests. Inline code rots.
**Alternatives considered:** Always inline (maintenance burden), always link (poor reading experience)

## 2026-03-11: icp-cli content — link, don't duplicate
**Context:** icp-cli has its own comprehensive docs at cli.internetcomputer.org/
**Decision:** Link to icp-cli docs. Inline icp-cli commands in guides where they aid reading flow. Don't duplicate guides.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth. The migration guide is the only exception (synced).
**Alternatives considered:** Sync more content (maintenance burden), duplicate quickstart (violates single-source principle)

## 2026-03-11: docs/ is the canonical content directory
**Context:** Astro/Starlight expects content at `src/content/docs/`, but `docs/` at root is the natural location for documentation
**Decision:** Real files live in `docs/` (project root). `src/content/docs/` is a symlink pointing to `../../docs`. All agent instructions and documentation reference `docs/` as the canonical path.
**Rationale:** `docs/` is shorter, more discoverable, and the standard convention. Astro follows the symlink transparently — builds work unchanged.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep files in `src/content/docs/` (forces long paths), no symlink (agents navigate three levels deep)

## 2026-03-11: Motoko sidebar pre-configured, no stubs for synced content
**Context:** Motoko docs (~60 files across fundamentals/, icp-features/, reference/) are synced from `caffeinelabs/motoko` via a sync script on `restructuring-attempt-1`
**Decision:** Keep the sidebar config with `autogenerate` directives for the three Motoko subdirectories. Do not create stub files — they would be overwritten by the sync. Only the hand-written `index.md` (overview) exists as a stub.
**Rationale:** `autogenerate` picks up files automatically once the sync runs. Creating 60 stubs adds no value and creates merge noise.
**Alternatives considered:** Create stubs for all 60 pages (would be overwritten), wait to configure sidebar until sync is restored (risks forgetting the structure)

## 2026-03-11: Image/asset strategy — `src/assets/images/` with section-based organization
**Context:** Portal has hand-drawn diagrams worth carrying over. No image strategy existed for the new docs.
**Decision:** Images live in `src/assets/images/`, organized by docs section (concepts/, guides/canister-management/, etc.). Carry over portal images case-by-case during content writing — not bulk-imported upfront. Keep the existing hand-drawn visual style. Use descriptive kebab-case filenames.
**Rationale:** `src/assets/` enables Astro image optimization (Sharp). Section-based organization mirrors the docs structure.
**Alternatives considered:** `public/images/` (no optimization), co-located images next to .md files (clutters docs/), bulk import all portal images (wasteful)

## 2026-03-11: Use relative paths with `.md` extension for internal links
**Context:** Absolute paths like `/getting-started/quickstart/` broke on GitHub
**Decision:** All internal links must use relative paths with `.md` extension (e.g., `[Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md)`). A remark plugin (`plugins/remark-strip-md-extension.mjs`) strips `.md` at build time.
**Rationale:** Works on GitHub natively and on the Astro site after the plugin strips extensions.
**Alternatives considered:** Absolute paths (break on GitHub), paths without extension (break on GitHub)

## 2026-03-11: Motoko core library is the standard; base is legacy
**Context:** The Motoko `core` library (`mops.one/core`) supersedes `base`
**Decision:** Always recommend `core` over `base` in all docs. Link to `mops.one/core/docs` as the standard library reference. The base→core migration guide is synced from `caffeinelabs/motoko` — do not edit directly.
**Rationale:** `core` is actively developed with AI-friendly design, consistent naming, and stable memory support. `base` is legacy.
**Alternatives considered:** List both as equal options (confusing, encourages legacy use)

## 2026-03-11: Use "onchain" and "offchain" — no hyphens
**Context:** Inconsistent usage across docs (on-chain vs onchain, off-chain vs offchain)
**Decision:** Always use "onchain" and "offchain" (no hyphens) in all docs content. Never "on-chain", "off-chain", "on chain", or "off chain".
**Rationale:** "Onchain" is the prevailing convention in ICP ecosystem. "Offchain" follows the same pattern for consistency.

## 2026-03-13: Use "icp-cli" not "`icp` CLI" in prose
**Context:** Inconsistent references to the CLI tool — some pages say "the `icp` CLI", others say "icp-cli"
**Decision:** Always use "icp-cli" when referring to the tool/project in prose. Use `icp` (code-formatted) only when showing the literal command the user types (e.g., `icp deploy`). Never write "the `icp` CLI" or "the icp command-line tool".
**Rationale:** "icp-cli" is the official project name and is consistent with how the tool is referenced in its own docs and repo. Using the project name avoids ambiguity.

## 2026-03-11: Content writing pacing — batch per sprint
**Context:** Need a review strategy for content pages
**Decision:** Write all pages in a sprint as a batch, then review together. After each sprint, do a cross-reference verification pass.
**Rationale:** Batching allows cross-referencing between pages in the same sprint. Post-sprint verification catches broken links early.
**Alternatives considered:** One page at a time with review (too slow), no verification pass (broken links accumulate)

## 2026-03-11: Content writing before infrastructure restoration
**Context:** P0 infrastructure tasks (validation scripts, sync scripts) are pending alongside P0 content.
**Decision:** Start content writing before restoring validation/sync scripts. Infra is not blocking content work.
**Rationale:** Validation scripts catch issues but don't prevent writing. Content is the primary deliverable.
**Alternatives considered:** Infra first (delays content), in parallel (splits focus)

## 2026-03-11: CI deployment to IC asset canister
**Context:** Docs needed automated deployment to the Internet Computer for live preview.
**Decision:** Deploy to asset canister `2akpg-uqaaa-aaaal-qv5ha-cai` on every push to `main` via GitHub Actions + icp-cli. Custom domain: `beta-docs.internetcomputer.org`. Asset canister configured with `.ic-assets.json5` (no raw access, standard security headers, immutable caching for hashed `_astro/` assets). Canister ID stored in `.icp/data/mappings/ic.ids.json` (committed). Deployer identity imported from `DFX_IDENTITY_DESIGN_TEAM` secret in `IC mainnet` GitHub environment.
**Rationale:** Matches the pattern used by icskills repo. icp-cli is the standard deployment tool. Raw access disabled for security.
**Alternatives considered:** Deploy via dfx (deprecated), manual deployment (error-prone)

## 2026-03-12: Corrected dependency layers and execution order for content writing
**Context:** Analysis of stub page cross-links revealed dependency errors in the original sprint ordering.
**Decision:** (1) Reordered Sprint 1 to write Layer 0 concept pages before getting-started pages. (2) Swapped candid before onchain-calls in Sprint 2. (3) Added `orthogonal-persistence` as explicit dependency for `data-persistence`. (4) Moved `what-next.md` to end of Sprint 1. (5) Added Layer column and "Dependency Layers" section to `migration-plan.md`.
**Rationale:** Correcting the dependency order ensures agents don't start pages before their prerequisites exist. The critical path is 6 layers deep.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep original ordering with "soft" dependencies (risks broken cross-links)

## 2026-03-12: Adopt Beads for multi-agent task coordination
**Context:** Multiple developers will run agents in parallel. `progress.md` on `main` can't reflect in-flight work on unmerged branches.
**Decision:** Use [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`) as the coordination layer for all migration work. Key design choices:

- **Scope:** All tasks in `migration-plan.md` — content pages, infrastructure, and any future tasks.
- **Task states:** `open` → `in_progress` (claimed) → `draft` (PR opened) → `closed` (PR merged)
- **Soft dependencies:** A task is "unblocked" when all its dependencies are at least `draft`.
- **Stale claim timeout:** 1 hour.
- **Agent priority order:** (A) Fix "changes requested" PRs → (B) Rebase approved PRs with merge conflicts → (C) Pick new work via `bd ready`
- **Branch naming:** `docs/<slug>` for content, `infra/<slug>` for infrastructure tasks
- **PR-based review:** Any agent can pick up "changes requested" PRs, not just the original author.
- **Merge conflict policy:** Always rebase before pushing. Don't rebase PRs under review. Do rebase approved PRs blocked by conflicts.
- **`progress.md` deletion:** Once all tasks are imported into Beads, delete `progress.md`. Do not initialize Beads tasks until the migration plan is finalized.

**Rationale:** Beads uses Dolt (version-controlled SQL) that syncs via `refs/dolt/data` — independent of content branches. Solves the branch-isolation problem.
**Alternatives considered:** GitHub Issues (no dependency graph), `progress.md` with merge-to-main cadence (agents blocked on merges), Linear/Jira (external dependency)

## 2026-03-12: Per-page sync recommendations and content lifecycle preparation
**Context:** 80 pages will be written by agents, but we don't know upfront which should be synced from upstream repos vs. hand-written.
**Decision:** Three changes:
1. **Sync recommendation per page:** Every content PR must include an `<!-- Upstream: ... -->` HTML comment classifying the page as `hand-written`, `sync from <repo> <path>`, or `informed by <repo> <path>`.
2. **Page proposals via GitHub Issues:** When agents discover uncovered topics, create a GitHub Issue with `page-proposal` label. Reference the issue in the PR.
3. **Content lifecycle strategy deferred to P2:** After Sprint 3-4, review sync recommendations, design upstream change detection, assign freshness ownership, and triage `page-proposal` issues.
**Rationale:** Collecting sync signals during writing is cheap and provides data for the lifecycle strategy later. GitHub Issues are the natural forum for humans to discuss page proposals.
**Alternatives considered:** Decide sync/hand-written upfront (premature), skip sync tracking (lose data)

## 2026-03-12: Source material repos as pinned git submodules

**Context:** Agents need to read source material from 7 upstream repos (portal, icp-cli, icp-cli-recipes, icp-cli-templates, icskills, examples, icp-js-sdk-docs). Without pinned refs, different agents could read different states of these repos, leading to inconsistent content.
**Decision:** Add all 7 source repos as shallow git submodules under `.sources/`. Pin each to a specific branch or tag:
- `portal` → `master`, `icp-cli` → `v0.2.0` (latest release tag), all others → `main`/`master` (their default branch)
- Agents must always read from `.sources/`, never from local clones, `gh api`, or training data
- Only the project maintainer bumps submodule refs
- When bumped, agents review upstream changes and update affected docs pages
**Rationale:** Submodules pin exact commits, ensuring reproducible reads across agents and sessions. Bumps are explicit and reviewable in PRs.
**Alternatives considered:** Document branch names only (agents still read different commits), local clones with documented paths (not portable), `gh api` fetches (slow, rate-limited, not reproducible)

## 2026-03-13: Diataxis content-type rules — no CLI commands in concept pages

**Context:** PR #2 (canisters concept page) included 6 `icp` CLI command blocks in the lifecycle section. Concept pages should explain *what* and *why*, not provide step-by-step procedures. The other concept pages (network-overview, app-architecture) correctly contained zero CLI commands, but the rule was implicit.
**Decision:** Added explicit Diataxis content-type rules to both CLAUDE.md ("Content rules") and CONTRIBUTING.md ("Content types (Diataxis)"). `concepts/` pages must not contain CLI commands or step-by-step procedures — link to the relevant guide instead. `getting-started/` and `guides/` pages may include CLI commands. `reference/` pages use them sparingly for syntax examples only.
**Rationale:** Making the rule explicit prevents future agents from mixing procedural content into explanatory pages. The Diataxis framework is already a stated design choice but the per-section implications for CLI command usage were not spelled out.

## 2026-03-13: Never link to internetcomputer.org/docs — it's being replaced

**Context:** The quickstart page linked to `internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/...` for Candid concepts. These URLs come from icp-cli source material which references the old portal docs.
**Decision:** Never link to `internetcomputer.org/docs/` or `docs.internetcomputer.org` — these are the old docs being replaced by this project. Instead: (1) link to a page in this docs site using relative paths, even if it's still a stub, or (2) link to Learn Hub (`learn.internetcomputer.org`) for protocol internals, or (3) explain the concept inline if no suitable page exists yet.
**Rationale:** Old docs URLs will break once the new site replaces the old one. Linking to stubs is fine — they'll have content by the time the site launches. If a topic has no planned page, flag it as a page proposal.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep old links with a TODO to update later (easy to forget, broken links at launch)

## 2026-03-13: Shared Claude Code permissions for parallel worktree agents

**Context:** Background agents launched in git worktrees need Bash, Edit, Read, etc. but block waiting for interactive permission approval that never comes. Per-user settings at `~/.claude/projects/<path>/settings.json` don't apply to worktree agents because the worktree has a different filesystem path.
**Decision:** Commit `.claude/settings.json` to the repo with pre-approved tools (git, npm, bd, gh, Edit, Write, Read, Grep, Glob). Deny destructive operations (force push, rm -rf). Gitignore `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.claude/worktrees/` (local-only).
**Rationale:** Shared settings travel with the repo and apply to all agents regardless of working directory. Every developer gets the same permission baseline without manual configuration.
**Alternatives considered:** Per-user project settings (doesn't apply to worktrees), fully permissive mode (too broad), manual approval (blocks background agents)

## 2026-03-13: No Beads git hooks — manual sync only

**Context:** `bd doctor` recommends installing git hooks (`pre-commit`, `post-merge`, `pre-push`) that auto-sync Beads state on git operations. During Sprint 1, the Dolt journal corrupted when the parent agent ran parallel `bd` commands while worktree agents were active.
**Decision:** Do not install Beads git hooks. All `bd dolt pull`/`push` calls must be manual and serialized. Only the parent agent may run `bd` commands — worktree agents must never touch Beads.
**Rationale:** Git hooks fire automatically on git operations (push, pull, checkout). Worktree agents perform these git operations concurrently, so hooks would trigger concurrent `bd` calls against the shared Dolt server, risking journal corruption. Manual serialized calls give the parent full control over when Beads is accessed.
**Alternatives considered:** Install hooks only on the main worktree (hooks still fire on parent git ops during agent runs), install hooks with a lock file (Dolt doesn't support external locking), use `--sandbox` mode for agents (still shares the server)

## 2026-03-13: Squash-merge only, auto-delete branches

**Context:** Agent PRs accumulate multiple commits (draft, feedback fixes, rebases) that aren't meaningful individually.
**Decision:** Enforce squash-merge as the only merge method on GitHub. Auto-delete branches after merge. Squash commit uses PR title and PR body.
**Rationale:** Keeps `git log` on `main` clean (one commit per page/feature). PR history is always available on GitHub. Auto-delete prevents stale `docs/<slug>` branches from accumulating.
**Alternatives considered:** Merge commits (noisy history), rebase merge (preserves individual commits nobody needs)

## 2026-03-17: Merge binding-generation page into Candid interface guide

**Context:** The planned `guides/canister-calls/binding-generation.md` had significant overlap with the existing Candid interface guide, which already covered `.did` generation and JS binding usage. The two dedicated binding tools are `@icp-sdk/bindgen` (JS/TS) and `ic-cdk-bindgen` (Rust) — `didc bind` should not be advertised for binding generation.
**Decision:** (1) Merged all binding-generation content into `candid.md` as a "Binding generation" section. (2) Removed the `binding-generation.md` stub. (3) Updated `didc` tool table to focus on validation/encoding (removed `didc bind` rows). (4) Documented both auto-generated and hand-written `.did` file paths for Motoko. (5) Updated `onchain-calls.md` canister discovery section with a cross-link to the new bindings section. (6) Removed Beads task and updated migration plan dependencies.
**Rationale:** The developer flow is linear: define interface → generate `.did` → generate bindings → use them. Splitting bindings into a separate page creates an artificial seam. The Candid guide is the natural home for the full flow.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep separate page (creates overlap and navigation friction), move all `.did` generation to the bindings page (splits related content)

## 2026-03-19: Use .mdx with Starlight Tabs for multi-language pages, strip to clean markdown for agents

**Context:** Guide pages showing both Motoko and Rust examples had no language toggle — readers scrolled past the other language's content. Starlight's `<Tabs>` component with `syncKey="lang"` syncs all tab groups on the page and persists the selection to `localStorage` across pages.
**Decision:** Pages with parallel Motoko/Rust examples use `.mdx` with Starlight's `<Tabs syncKey="lang">` and `<TabItem label="Motoko">` / `<TabItem label="Rust">`. The agent-docs plugin strips MDX artifacts from `.mdx` sources to produce clean `.md` endpoints: `<TabItem label="X">` becomes a `### X` heading (level derived from parent), ESM imports are removed (only outside code fences — Motoko `import` statements are preserved), JSX wrapper tags and comments are stripped. A validation pass on every build checks generated `.md` for leftover JSX, missing language tags, heading hierarchy violations, and other artifacts.
**Rules:** (1) `.md` remains the default — only use `.mdx` when a page needs interactive components like synced tabs. (2) `syncKey="lang"` for all language tabs — ensures global persistence. (3) **Tab order follows "source → derived":** for implementation/code tabs, list Motoko first, then Rust, then other languages (JavaScript). For type-mapping tabs where Candid is the canonical definition (e.g., Records, Variants), list Candid first, then Motoko, then Rust — Candid defines the interface, the languages are projections of it. (4) The `<!-- Upstream: -->` comment uses MDX syntax `{/* Upstream: ... */}` in `.mdx` files. (5) All content inside `<TabItem>` must be valid markdown (no nested JSX beyond what Starlight provides). (6) **No markdown headings inside `<TabItem>` blocks** — Starlight generates the "On this page" TOC at build time from all headings regardless of active tab, so headings inside tabs always appear in the TOC even when hidden. Use bold text (`**Title**`) for sub-labels inside tabs instead.
**Rationale:** Starlight's built-in Tabs handle accessibility, keyboard nav, and persistence out of the box — no custom plugin needed. The `.mdx` approach optimizes human reading experience while the stripping logic produces well-structured agent markdown with language-labeled headings. The remark-directive alternative was rejected because it requires building/maintaining a custom plugin to replicate what Starlight already provides.
**Alternatives considered:** (1) Remark-directive plugin with plain `.md` (custom infrastructure to maintain, reimplements Starlight features), (2) Keep `.md`-only with `## Motoko:` / `## Rust:` headings (no interactive tabs, poor human UX), (3) Separate pages per language (breaks the "one guide, pick your language" pattern)

## 2026-03-19: Worktree agents must initialize submodules before starting work

**Context:** Skills and source material are accessed via a symlink chain: `.claude/skills/` → `.agents/skills/` → `.sources/<submodule>/skills/`. All `.sources/` entries are git submodules. When `git worktree add` creates a new worktree, submodules are NOT initialized — `.sources/` contains only empty directories, breaking all skill symlinks and making source material inaccessible.
**Decision:** Every worktree agent must run `git submodule update --init --depth 1` as its very first command. The parent agent must include this instruction in every worktree agent's prompt. This costs ~336MB disk and ~30 seconds per worktree; both are reclaimed when the worktree is removed.
**Rationale:** Alternatives were evaluated and rejected: (1) Symlinking `.sources/` to the main repo's copy — works for file access but causes 13 spurious deletion entries in `git status` that could confuse agents into staging them; symlinking individual submodule dirs causes a hard `git status` error (exit 128). (2) `submodule.recurse=true` git config — does not auto-init submodules on `git worktree add`. (3) Vendoring skills into the repo — loses automatic sync with upstream skill repos. The submodule init approach is the only one with zero git side effects (clean status, no surprises), which is critical for agents operating autonomously.
**Alternatives considered:** Shared `.sources/` symlink (dirty git status confuses agents), `submodule.recurse` config (doesn't work for worktree creation), vendored skills (manual sync burden)

## 2026-03-19: Sync ic.did from portal and check on submodule bumps

**Context:** The management canister Candid interface (`ic.did`) is the machine-readable type definition for all management canister methods. It lives in the portal repo at `docs/references/_attachments/ic.did` and is embedded in the IC interface spec page. The IC repo (`dfinity/ic`) also has a copy in `packages/ic-management-canister-types/tests/ic.did`, but it may include unreleased changes. The portal version represents the released spec.
**Decision:** Copy `ic.did` from `.sources/portal/` into `public/reference/ic.did` (static asset, not content). Reference it from the management canister page. On portal submodule bumps, diff `ic.did` — if it changed, re-copy and update `management-canister.md` plus any guides referencing affected methods. Added "Synced files from submodules" section to AGENTS.md with a bump checklist.
**Rationale:** Developers need the Candid interface for binding generation and type checking. Copying rather than symlinking ensures the file is served by the docs site. The portal version is the released source of truth; the IC repo version may be ahead with unreleased changes.
**Alternatives considered:** Symlink to `.sources/` (not served by Astro build), link to GitHub raw URL (breaks offline, no version control), add IC repo as submodule (too large)

## 2026-03-19: Drop icskills frontmatter field — advertise via skills registry instead

**Context:** Every docs page had an optional `icskills: [ckbtc, evm-rpc]` frontmatter field tagging related IC skills for AI agent discovery. However, `cleanMarkdown()` in the agent-docs plugin strips all frontmatter, so agents consuming `.md` endpoints or `llms.txt` never see it. The only consumers were agents reading raw repo files.
**Decision:** Remove the `icskills` field from the frontmatter schema, Zod validation, all stub pages, and documentation. Instead, advertise the skills registry endpoint (`https://skills.internetcomputer.org/.well-known/skills/index.json`) in `llms.txt`. icskills remain a source material repo — agents still read from `.sources/icskills/` and list them in `<!-- Upstream: -->` comments when used as source.
**Rationale:** The skills registry solves agent discovery at the site level. Per-page skill tags add maintenance overhead with no current consumer. If per-page hints are needed later, they can be added to the `.md` endpoints or `llms.txt` entries.
**Alternatives considered:** Emit skill tags in clean markdown output (adds complexity for narrow use case), keep frontmatter for future use (maintenance burden with no consumer)

## 2026-03-18: Move wallet-integration from authentication to DeFi section

**Context:** The wallet-integration page covers ICRC signer standards (ICRC-21/25/27/29/49) for transaction approval, not authentication. The wallet-integration icskill itself distinguishes wallet signers (transaction approval) from Internet Identity (authentication/login). Under `guides/authentication/`, the page was grouped with II and verifiable credentials — a different concern.
**Decision:** Move `guides/authentication/wallet-integration.md` → `guides/defi/wallet-integration.md`. Update cross-links in `what-next.md`, `internet-identity.md`, and `token-standards.md`. Update Beads task title. No sidebar config change needed (both directories use `autogenerate`).
**Rationale:** Transaction signing is closer to the DeFi/token workflow than to authentication. Developers looking for wallet transaction approval would look in DeFi, not Authentication. Discussed in PR #23 and filed as GitHub issue #25.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep in authentication (misleading grouping), create a new "Wallets" subsection (over-engineering for one page)

## 2026-04-15: Tightened sandbox permissions and autonomous worktree agent workflow

**Context:** The original `.claude/settings.json` had `"Bash"` as a blanket allow, which pre-approved all bash commands including `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` bypasses — meaning the sandbox could be silently bypassed without user visibility. Additionally, `~/.config/gh` in `denyRead` blocked `gh` commands from working inside the sandbox, and there was no technical guard against direct git manipulation of `refs/dolt/data`. Several commands that legitimately need sandbox bypass (submodule init, Dolt server start) were undocumented.
**Decision:** (1) Removed blanket `"Bash"` from `permissions.allow` — `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed: true` handles sandboxed commands automatically; only explicit `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` commands now need pre-approval. (2) Removed `~/.config/gh` from `filesystem.denyRead` — `gh` now works within the sandbox without bypass. (3) Added targeted pre-approvals for commands that legitimately need sandbox bypass: `git submodule update*` (`.git/` is hardcoded-protected by Claude Code), `bd dolt start*`, `bd dolt pull*`, `bd dolt push*`. (4) Added deny rules for direct git manipulation of `refs/dolt/data`: `git push * refs/dolt*`, `git push * --delete refs/dolt*`, `git push * :refs/dolt*`. (5) Added worktree agent prompt structure guidelines to AGENTS.md — parent passes only task ID + page path + skill instructions; worktrees do their own full research from `.sources/` and skills. (6) Changed review workflow: review worktree agents post `gh pr comment` directly (fully autonomous); parent no longer presents findings to user before posting.
**Rationale:** The blanket `"Bash"` allow was false security — it looked like bash was controlled but actually everything was pre-approved. The new model: sandboxed commands run silently (low risk, OS-isolated), pre-approved bypass commands cover the specific cases that need it (submodule init, Dolt), and `bd init --force` still prompts (it destroys local DB state). Pre-gathering source material in the parent before launching worktrees was producing lower-quality content because it bypassed the skill research workflow; worktrees reading primary sources directly produces better output.
**Alternatives considered:** Keep blanket `"Bash"` (no user visibility into bypasses), require user approval for `bd dolt push` (too noisy — fires on every status update), have parent collect review findings and present to user before posting (intentional pause, now removed for full autonomy)

## 2026-04-17: og-image.svg has a hardcoded domain

**Context:** `public/og-image.svg` contains the site URL in its footer text (`DFINITY Foundation  ·  beta-docs.internetcomputer.org`). The build plugin converts the SVG to `og-image.png` at build time, so the hardcoded URL ends up baked into the PNG served as the social share preview.
**Decision:** Keep the SVG as a static file (the domain changes at most once). When the site moves to its final domain, update the URL in `public/og-image.svg` alongside `astro.config.mjs` (`site`) and the og:image/twitter:image meta tags.
**Rationale:** Dynamic SVG generation in the build plugin adds ~30 lines of complexity for a one-time change. Static is simpler and good enough.
**Alternatives considered:** Generate SVG dynamically in `plugins/astro-agent-docs.mjs` using `siteUrl` from Astro config (more robust, but over-engineered for a single domain change)
