<!-- Content Brief -->
Explain chain-key cryptography from a developer perspective. Cover threshold ECDSA (Bitcoin/Ethereum signing), threshold Schnorr (Bitcoin Taproot), BLS signatures (consensus and certification), key management across subnets, and chain evolution technology (subnet membership changes without downtime). Focus on what developers can do with chain-key: sign for other chains, verify responses, build cross-chain apps.
