<!-- Content Brief -->
How to encrypt data on ICP using VetKeys. Cover the end-to-end flow: setting up a canister with VetKeys, encrypting data client-side with a transport key, storing encrypted data onchain, and decrypting with derived keys. Include patterns for: encrypted onchain storage (e.g. encrypted-notes), distributed key management (DKMS), identity-based encryption (IBE), and timelock encryption. Show both backend (Rust/Motoko canister code) and frontend (JS decryption) sides. Reference the encrypted-notes and vetkd examples as real-world implementations.
