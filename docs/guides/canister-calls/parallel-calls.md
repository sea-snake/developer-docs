<!-- Content Brief -->
Execute multiple inter-canister calls concurrently instead of sequentially. Cover futures::join_all in Rust, async/await patterns in Motoko, composite queries for read-only parallel calls. Handle partial failures when some calls succeed and others fail. Explain performance benefits and when parallel calls are appropriate.
