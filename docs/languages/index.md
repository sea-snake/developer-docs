ICP canisters compile to WebAssembly, so any language that targets Wasm can be used. There are two approaches: **Motoko** is a language purpose-built for IC -- its compiler handles system API bindings, Candid serialization, and persistence natively. For other languages, a **Canister Development Kit (CDK)** provides the glue between the language and the IC system API -- type-safe bindings for system calls, macros for exposing canister methods, and utilities for stable memory and inter-canister calls.

## Official languages

### [Motoko](motoko/index.md)

Purpose-built for the Internet Computer. Built-in actor model, orthogonal persistence, and async/await for inter-canister calls. Compiles directly to Wasm with no external toolchain.

### [Rust](rust/index.md)

Use the `ic-cdk` canister development kit with the full Rust ecosystem -- any crate that compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` works. Ideal when leveraging existing Rust libraries or integrating with Rust-based tooling.

## Community CDKs

These CDKs are built and maintained by the community. They enable ICP development in additional languages.
