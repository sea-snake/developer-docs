<!-- Content Brief -->
Verify that query responses from canisters are authentic. Cover client-side certificate verification using @icp-sdk/core, the service worker approach for transparent verification, and how the asset canister handles certification automatically. Explain when you need custom certification vs when the asset canister handles it.
