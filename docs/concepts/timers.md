<!-- Content Brief -->
Explain the global timer mechanism on ICP. Cover how the IC scheduler invokes timer callbacks, the difference between one-shot and periodic timers, comparison with the deprecated heartbeat mechanism (timers are more efficient and flexible), and scheduling guarantees (best-effort, not real-time). Focus on what developers need to understand to use timers reliably.
