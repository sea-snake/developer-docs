# Progress Tracker

Two tables: **project-level** (infrastructure, research, tooling) and **content** (all 82 content pages in priority order, plus 4 section index pages).

Pick the highest row with status `stub` or `pending`. For execution details (dependencies, source material, effort), see `migration-plan.md`.

## Status key

- `pending` — Not started (infrastructure/tooling tasks)
- `stub` — Stub page exists with frontmatter + content brief
- `in-progress` — Being worked on (add your name)
- `draft` — Content written, not yet reviewed
- `review` — Under review by relevant team
- `done` — Published and verified
