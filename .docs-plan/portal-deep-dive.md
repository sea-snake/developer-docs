# Portal Deep Dive

## Summary

- **Total portal docs files (excluding _attachments, tests, release notes):** 269 content files
- **Total including release notes:** 291 files (22 release notes)
- **Plus:** 1 home.mdx, 1 updates index
- **File format:** All `.mdx` (JSX-heavy, must be rewritten as plain `.md`)
- **Sections:** build-on-btc (14), building-apps (166), defi (43), references (23), tutorials (71), other (23)
- **Key finding:** ~60% of portal content maps to our planned structure. ~25% is end-user/NNS dapp content we should DROP. ~15% needs EVALUATE for partial extraction.
- **Flagged topics found:** HTTPS outcalls (5 files), timers (1), randomness (1), reproducible builds (1), canister snapshots (2), subnet types (1), binding generation (1 partial), canister discovery (0 explicit), cycles management (3), verifiable credentials (4), composite queries (in advanced-calls), certified variables (in advanced-calls + tutorial), SIMD (1), large Wasm (0 explicit, covered in compile.mdx)

|-----|-------------|----------------|
| **Verifiable credentials** (4 files) | building-apps/network-features/verifiable-credentials/*.mdx | Add guides/authentication/verifiable-credentials.md or fold into internet-identity.md |
| **VetKeys** (8 files) | building-apps/network-features/vetkeys/*.mdx | concepts/vetkeys.md covers explanation; may need guides/backends/vetkeys.md for how-to |
| **NFT collections** | defi/nft-collections.mdx | No explicit NFT guide planned; fold into guides/defi/token-ledgers.md |
| **Async code patterns** | references/async-code.mdx | Important content about Rust/Motoko async; needs home in guides/inter-canister/calls.md |
| **Application architectures** | building-apps/best-practices/application-architectures.mdx | concepts/app-architecture.md covers this but may need more depth |
| **Agent SDK guides** | building-apps/interact-with-canisters/agents/{overview,javascript-agent,nodejs,rust-agent}.mdx | JS agent content links to JS SDK; Rust agent needs coverage in languages/rust/ |
| **Rosetta API** (13 files) | defi/rosetta/**/*.mdx | guides/defi/rosetta.md is a single page; may need expansion for this volume |
| **Canister discovery** | No explicit portal file | New content needed for guides/production/canister-discovery.md |
| **Binding generation** | building-apps/developer-tools/cdks/rust/generating-candid.mdx, building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-tools.mdx | guides/inter-canister/binding-generation.md needs both files |
| **HSM identities** | references/using-hsm-with-identities.mdx | Niche but valuable; evaluate for guides/security/access-management.md |
| **Dashboard APIs** | references/dashboard-apis.mdx | No planned page; consider reference/system-canisters.md |
| **Formal verification** | building-apps/security/formal-verification.mdx | No planned page; fold into guides/testing/strategies.md |
| **SIMD** | building-apps/network-features/simd.mdx | No dedicated page; fold into guides/backends/large-wasm.md or create new guide |
| **Idempotency** | building-apps/best-practices/idempotency.mdx | Important pattern; fold into guides/backends/data-persistence.md |

## DeFi Content Analysis

**43 DeFi files** (excluding release notes) break into:

| Subcategory | File Count | Triage Recommendation |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Top-level DeFi (overview, concepts, best practices) | 8 | KEEP-REWRITE into guides/defi/token-ledgers.md |
| Chain-key tokens (ckBTC, ckETH, ckERC20) | 9 | KEEP-REWRITE into guides/defi/chain-key-tokens.md |
| Rosetta APIs (ICP + ICRC) | 13 | KEEP-REWRITE into guides/defi/rosetta.md (single page may be too small for 13 source files; consider splitting) |
| Token standards (ICRC-1, ICRC-2, ICRC-7, ICRC-37) | 5 | KEEP-REWRITE into reference/token-standards.md |
| Token ledgers (setup, usage, upgrade, cycles ledger) | 6 | KEEP-REWRITE into guides/defi/token-ledgers.md |
| Token indexes + integrations | 2 | KEEP-REWRITE into guides/defi/token-ledgers.md |

**Recommendation:** The 3 planned DeFi pages (token-ledgers, chain-key-tokens, rosetta) may be too few for 43 source files. Consider:
1. `guides/defi/token-ledgers.md` -- ledger setup, usage, indexes, integrations, cycles ledger (14 source files)
2. `guides/defi/chain-key-tokens.md` -- ckBTC, ckETH, ckERC20 (9 source files)
3. `guides/defi/rosetta.md` -- Rosetta API reference, may need a second page or heavy summarization (13 source files)
4. `reference/token-standards.md` -- ICRC standards (5 source files)
5. Consider adding: `guides/defi/exchange-rates.md` for the XRC canister usage

## Chain Fusion Content Analysis

Chain Fusion content is scattered across three portal sections:

| Section | Files | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| build-on-btc/ | 14 | Bitcoin-specific: BTC API, transactions, regtest, ordinals, runes, BRC-20 |
| building-apps/chain-fusion/ | 16 | Cross-chain: overview, Ethereum/EVM RPC, Solana, Dogecoin, examples |
| building-apps/network-features/signatures/ | 2 | Threshold signatures (tECDSA, tSchnorr) |
| references/bitcoin-how-it-works.mdx | 1 | Bitcoin integration internals |
| references/t-sigs-how-it-works.mdx | 1 | Threshold signatures internals |
| defi/chain-key-tokens/ | 9 | ckBTC, ckETH, ckERC20 (DeFi side of chain fusion) |

**Total: 43 files across 3 sections**

**Consolidation plan:**
1. `concepts/chain-fusion.md` -- What chain fusion is, supported chains, how tECDSA/tSchnorr work (from overview + references)
2. `guides/chain-fusion/bitcoin.md` -- BTC API, transactions, dev env, regtest (14 build-on-btc files + reference/bitcoin-how-it-works)
3. `guides/chain-fusion/ethereum.md` -- ETH workflow, addresses, signing, EVM RPC (12 files from chain-fusion/ethereum/)
4. `guides/chain-fusion/solana.md` -- Solana integration (1 file, early stage)
5. `guides/chain-fusion/dogecoin.md` -- Dogecoin integration (1 file, early stage)
6. `guides/defi/chain-key-tokens.md` -- ckBTC/ckETH/ckERC20 usage in dapps (9 files, DeFi-oriented)

**Note:** Ordinals, Runes, and BRC-20 content (3 files) is niche. Recommend EVALUATE -- include as subsections of bitcoin.md only if demand warrants it.
