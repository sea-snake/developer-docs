Motoko is a high-level programming language designed specifically for building canisters on the Internet Computer. It combines a familiar syntax (drawing from JavaScript, Rust, Swift, and Java) with features that map directly to how ICP works: an actor-based programming model, orthogonal persistence, async/await for inter-canister messaging, and compilation to WebAssembly.

If you want a language where ICP concepts are first-class citizens rather than library abstractions, Motoko is a strong choice.

## Key features

**Actor model.** Every Motoko canister is an actor — an isolated unit of state and behavior that communicates with other actors through asynchronous messages. This maps directly to how canisters work on ICP: each canister has private state and a public interface.

**Orthogonal persistence.** Variables declared in a `persistent actor` survive canister upgrades automatically. There is no database layer, no serialization code, and no pre/post-upgrade hooks needed for most use cases. See [Orthogonal persistence](../../concepts/orthogonal-persistence.md) for how this works at the platform level.

**Async/await messaging.** Inter-canister calls use `async`/`await`, making sequential message flows read like synchronous code. The compiler and runtime handle the underlying callback mechanics.

**Strong typing.** Motoko has a sound type system with generics, variant types, pattern matching, and option types (`?T`) that prevent null-pointer errors at compile time.

**WebAssembly compilation.** Motoko compiles to Wasm, the execution format for all ICP canisters. The compiler handles ICP-specific concerns (Candid serialization, system API bindings, memory management) so you don't have to.

## Quick example

A minimal Motoko canister with a query method and an update method:

```motoko
persistent actor Counter {
  var count : Nat = 0;

  public query func get() : async Nat {
    return count;
  };

  public func increment() : async () {
    count += 1;
  };
};
```

The `persistent actor` declaration means `count` survives canister upgrades. The `query` keyword marks `get` as a fast, read-only call. The `increment` function is an update call that modifies state and goes through consensus.

## Getting started

Create a new Motoko project with icp-cli:

```bash
icp new my-project --subfolder motoko
```

This generates a Motoko canister project with an `icp.yaml` build configuration and a source file. The build configuration uses the Motoko recipe:

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: backend
    recipe:
      type: "@dfinity/motoko@<version>"
      configuration:
        main: src/main.mo
        shrink: true
```

Start a local network and deploy:

```bash
icp network start -d
icp deploy
```

## Standard library: `core`

The **`core`** package ([mops.one/core](https://mops.one/core)) is the standard library for Motoko. It supersedes the older `base` library with a cleaner API, consistent naming conventions, and data structures that work directly with stable memory.

Add it to your project's `mops.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
core = "2.2.0" # Check the latest version at https://mops.one/core

[toolchain]
moc = "1.3.0" # Check the latest version at https://github.com/caffeinelabs/motoko/releases
```

Then import modules:

```motoko
import Map "mo:core/Map";
import Text "mo:core/Text";
import List "mo:core/List";
```

Key improvements in `core` over `base`:

- All data structures can be stored in stable memory without pre/post-upgrade hooks
- Clear separation between mutable (`Map`, `Set`, `List`) and immutable (`pure/Map`, `pure/Set`, `pure/List`) data structures
- Hash-based collections removed in favor of ordered maps and sets (better security against collision attacks)
- Consistent naming: `values()` instead of `vals()`, `Cycles` instead of `ExperimentalCycles`

If you have an existing project using `base`, you can migrate incrementally — both libraries can coexist in the same project. See the [base to core migration guide](base-core-migration.md) for detailed instructions.

`core` and all other Motoko packages are managed with [Mops](https://mops.one), which handles dependency resolution, compiler toolchain management, and publishing. Browse community packages at [mops.one](https://mops.one).
