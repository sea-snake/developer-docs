# ICP Developer Docs — Agent & Contributor Instructions

ICP developer documentation built with Astro + Starlight.
All content is plain `.md` files. No `.mdx`. No JSX.
Goal: get developers (human and AI) building on the IC as fast as possible.

This file is the single source of truth for all agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) and contributors. `CLAUDE.md` symlinks here.

**Current state:** All content is stub pages. Task coordination uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`). See "Multi-agent workflow" below.

## Quick orientation

1. Read this file for rules and boundaries
2. Check `.docs-plan/decisions.md` before making any structural changes
3. Sync task state: `bd dolt pull`
4. Pick a task using the priority order in "Multi-agent workflow" below
5. Look up that task in `.docs-plan/migration-plan.md` for dependencies, source material, and effort
6. Do the work following the rules below
7. Record any structural decisions in `.docs-plan/decisions.md`

For research artifacts (portal triage, Learn Hub mapping, examples inventory), see `.docs-plan/README.md`.

## Multi-agent workflow

All tasks (content pages, infrastructure, tooling) are coordinated through [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads). Beads uses Dolt (version-controlled SQL) that syncs via `refs/dolt/data` — independent of content branches. Every agent sees the same task state regardless of which branch they're on.

### Task states

`open` → `in_progress` (claimed) → `draft` (PR opened) → `closed` (PR merged)

**Soft dependencies:** A task is "unblocked" when all its dependencies are at least `draft`. This means you can start a page once its dependency's PR exists — you don't need to wait for the merge.

### Session start

```bash
bd dolt pull    # sync task state from remote
```

Then scan for work in this priority order:

**Priority A — Fix "changes requested" PRs** (unblocks reviews, highest value)
```bash
gh pr list --search "review:changes_requested" --json number,title,headRefName
```
Cross-reference with Beads: the task should be in `draft` status. If it's `in_progress`, another agent is already on it — skip.

**Priority B — Rebase approved PRs with merge conflicts** (quick, unblocks merges)
```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,mergeable,reviewDecision \
  --jq '.[] | select(.mergeable == "CONFLICTING" and .reviewDecision == "APPROVED")'
```

**Priority C — New work**
```bash
bd ready    # shows unblocked tasks (deps in draft/closed)
```

### Claiming a task

Before any files are touched:
```bash
bd update <id> --status in_progress --claim && bd dolt push
```
This is atomic — claim + push happens immediately. The race window for duplicate claims is negligible (sub-second).

**Stale claims:** If a task has been `in_progress` for >1 hour with no PR in notes, treat it as a crashed session. Reclaim it.

### Pre-flight check

```bash
git ls-remote origin docs/<slug>      # branch exists?
gh pr list --head docs/<slug>         # PR exists?
```

Three outcomes:
- **Branch + PR exist** → "changes requested" pickup. `git fetch origin && git checkout docs/<slug>`
- **Branch exists, no PR** → stale from a crashed agent. Delete remote branch, start fresh from `main`
- **Neither exists** → fresh work. `git checkout -b docs/<slug> main`

### Branch naming

- Content pages: `docs/<slug>` (e.g., `docs/concepts-canisters`, `docs/guides-backends-timers`)
- Infrastructure tasks: `infra/<slug>` (e.g., `infra/validation-scripts`, `infra/ci-workflows`)

### Doing the work

- **Fresh task:** Follow the "Content authoring workflow" below (for content pages) or task-specific instructions in `migration-plan.md` (for infrastructure)
- **Changes requested:** Read review comments via `gh pr view <PR#> --json reviews`, address each comment, push fixes to the existing branch

### Submitting

**Fresh task:**
```bash
git rebase origin/main                # prevent merge conflicts
git push -u origin docs/<slug>
gh pr create --title "docs: <page title>" --body "..."
bd update <id> --status draft --notes "PR #<number>" && bd dolt push
```

**Changes requested fix:**
```bash
git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main    # rebase as part of the fix
git push
bd update <id> --status draft && bd dolt push
```

**Rebase approved PR (Priority B):**
```bash
git fetch origin && git checkout <branch>
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Merge conflict policy

- **Always** rebase on `main` before pushing (both fresh PRs and "changes requested" fixes)
- **Don't** rebase PRs that are under review — force-pushing changes the diff the reviewer is looking at
- **Do** rebase approved PRs that are blocked by merge conflicts
- **Do** rebase as part of "changes requested" fixes

### After PR merge

```bash
bd update <id> --status closed && bd dolt push
```

### Agent can't finish

If you hit a blocker (missing source material, unclear requirements):
```bash
bd update <id> --status open && bd dolt push    # unclaim, leave a note
```
Add context in the Beads notes so the next agent (or human) understands the blocker.

## Always (do these without asking)

- Read `.docs-plan/decisions.md` before proposing structural changes
- **Load the relevant icskill before any ICP-related work** — not just content writing. This includes CI workflows, `icp.yaml` config, deployment setup, and any task involving icp-cli commands or configuration. Load the skill first, then do the work.
- Use the `technical-documentation` skill when drafting or reviewing docs (if available)
- Use icp-cli commands in all CLI examples — never `dfx`
- Write plain `.md` files only — never `.mdx` or JSX
- Include complete frontmatter (see CONTRIBUTING.md for schema)
- Make code examples self-contained and copy-pasteable
- Link to external docs instead of duplicating content (see linking rules below)
- Read the stub page's `<!-- Source Material -->` and `<!-- Content Brief -->` comments before writing content
- Sync Beads before and after work: `bd dolt pull` at session start, `bd dolt push` after every status change
- Update task status in Beads immediately — claim before working, set `draft` after PR creation, set `closed` after merge
- Record structural decisions in `.docs-plan/decisions.md` immediately when making them — don't wait to be asked. This includes: new files/symlinks, path changes, config changes, cleanup of stale references, and any choice that a future agent would need to understand.

## Ask first (confirm with the user before doing these)

- Creating new top-level sections (getting-started, guides, concepts, languages, reference)
- Adding new pages not in the migration plan (propose in PR description, don't create)
- Removing existing pages from the structure
- Changing a page's sync recommendation from hand-written to synced (or vice versa)
- Changing the frontmatter schema
- Modifying the sidebar configuration in `astro.config.mjs`
- Changing decisions recorded in `.docs-plan/decisions.md`
- Adding new external doc sources to the linking rules

## Never (do not do these under any circumstances)

- Reference `dfx` — it is deprecated and banned
- Create `.mdx` files or use JSX components
- Duplicate content that lives in external docs (icp-cli, JS SDK, icskills, Learn Hub)
- Edit synced files directly (`docs/languages/motoko/`, `docs/guides/tools/migrating-from-dfx.md`)
- Nest sidebar items more than 3 levels deep
- Skip reading source material before writing a page
- Modify the rationale or context of existing decisions in `.docs-plan/decisions.md` — you may remove entries that are fully reflected in the current codebase (renames, file moves, cleanup) but never alter the reasoning behind active decisions

## Key directories

- `docs/` — All documentation (`.md` only). This is the real directory; `src/content/docs/` is a symlink for Astro.
- `docs/languages/motoko/` — Auto-synced from `caffeinelabs/motoko` (do not edit directly)
- `docs/guides/tools/migrating-from-dfx.md` — Synced from `dfinity/icp-cli` (do not edit directly)
- `.docs-plan/` — Analysis artifacts, decisions, and progress tracking (see `.docs-plan/README.md`)
- `.sources/` — **Pinned submodules of upstream source repos** (see "Source material repos" below)
- `icp.yaml` — icp-cli project config (asset canister recipe)
- `.icp/data/` — Canister ID mappings (committed to git). `.icp/cache/` is gitignored.

## Source material repos (`.sources/`)

All upstream source repos are pinned as **git submodules** under `.sources/`. This ensures every agent reads the exact same content, regardless of when they run.

| Submodule | Repo | Pinned to | What it provides |
|-----------|------|-----------|-----------------|
| `.sources/portal` | `dfinity/portal` | `master` | Old docs content referenced in stub `<!-- Source Material -->` comments |
| `.sources/icp-cli` | `dfinity/icp-cli` | `v0.2.0` (latest release) | CLI reference, command syntax verification |
| `.sources/icp-cli-recipes` | `dfinity/icp-cli-recipes` | `main` | Recipe examples for CLI guides |
| `.sources/icp-cli-templates` | `dfinity/icp-cli-templates` | `main` | Project templates for getting-started |
| `.sources/icskills` | `dfinity/icskills` | `main` | Skill files with canister IDs and code patterns |
| `.sources/examples` | `dfinity/examples` | `master` | Code examples (link to for >30 line snippets) |
| `.sources/icp-js-sdk-docs` | `dfinity/icp-js-sdk-docs` | `main` | JS SDK documentation |

### Rules for agents

- **Always read source material from `.sources/`** — never from local clones, `gh api`, or your training data
- **Stub shorthand mapping:** `Portal: building-apps/foo.mdx` → `.sources/portal/docs/building-apps/foo.mdx`, `icp-cli: guides/bar.md` → `.sources/icp-cli/docs/guides/bar.md`
- **CLI command verification:** Check `.sources/icp-cli/docs/reference/cli.md` — do not guess flags or syntax
- **Do not modify `.sources/`** — these are read-only references. Edits go to the upstream repos.
- **After cloning this repo:** Run `git submodule update --init --depth 1` to fetch all submodules

### Bumping submodules

Only the project maintainer bumps submodule refs. When bumped:

1. Check what changed: `git -C .sources/<repo> log --oneline <old-ref>..<new-ref>`
2. Review if any existing docs pages are affected by the upstream changes
3. Update affected pages and note the bump in the PR description

## Planning artifacts (`.docs-plan/`)

Check these every session:

| File | What it answers |
|------|-----------------|
| `decisions.md` | "Has this been decided already?" — append-only decision log |
| `migration-plan.md` | "How do I execute this task?" — dependencies, source material, effort per page |

> **Task state** is tracked in Beads (`bd ready`), not in a file. See "Multi-agent workflow" above.

Read these when writing specific pages:

| File | What it answers |
|------|-----------------|
| `synthesis.md` | "Why is the structure this way?" — full rationale |
| `portal-deep-dive.md` | "What portal content maps to this page?" |
| `learn-hub-inventory.md` | "Which Learn Hub articles should I link to?" |
| `jssdk-skills-mapping.md` | "Which icskills and JS SDK docs are relevant?" |
| `icp-cli-examples-inventory.md` | "Which CLI docs, recipes, templates, examples to reference?" |
| `developer-journey.md` | "How does this page fit the developer journey?" |

## Content authoring workflow

> **Task coordination:** Follow the "Multi-agent workflow" section above for claiming tasks, branch creation, and PR submission. The steps below cover the content writing process itself.

When drafting a new docs page:

1. Read the stub page — it contains content brief, source material, and cross-links
2. Read source material from `.sources/`. Stub references use shorthand — resolve them per the mapping in "Source material repos" above (e.g., `Portal: building-apps/foo.mdx` → `.sources/portal/docs/building-apps/foo.mdx`).
   > **If source material is unavailable at the expected path:** (1) search `.sources/portal/` for the content under a different path, (2) if truly unavailable, write from the content brief + icskills + your training knowledge, and add `<!-- Source unavailable: [path] — written from content brief -->` so future contributors know to verify.
3. Read any related icskills skill file from `.sources/icskills/` for accurate canister IDs and code patterns
4. Write the content:
   - Follow the content brief in the stub
   - Use icp-cli commands (never dfx)
   - **Verify all CLI commands and flags** against `.sources/icp-cli/docs/reference/cli.md` — never guess command syntax
   - Use plain markdown (never JSX/MDX)
   - Ensure complete frontmatter (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - Code examples: <30 lines inline, >30 lines link to `dfinity/examples`
   - Link to external docs per linking rules below
5. **Sync recommendation:** After reading source material, decide whether this page should be:
   - **Hand-written** — original content, no upstream equivalent
   - **Synced** — upstream repo has authoritative content that should be auto-synced (like Motoko docs)
   - **Upstream-informed** — hand-written but closely tracks an upstream source that should be monitored for changes
   Record your recommendation as an HTML comment at the bottom of the page:
   ```markdown
   <!-- Upstream: hand-written -->
   <!-- Upstream: sync from dfinity/icp-cli docs/guides/canister-migration.md -->
   <!-- Upstream: informed by dfinity/portal docs/building-apps/canister-management/settings.mdx -->
   ```
   Consider syncing when the upstream content is comprehensive, well-maintained, and a close fit. Prefer hand-writing when the page synthesizes multiple sources or serves a different audience than the upstream.
6. **Propose missing pages:** If source material reveals topics that aren't covered by any existing page in the plan (e.g., a canister migration guide in icp-cli with no corresponding docs page), create a GitHub Issue with the `page-proposal` label. Include: what the page would cover, where it would live in the structure, and which upstream source it would draw from. Reference the issue in your PR description. Do not create the page — just flag it for human discussion.
7. Submit: push branch, create PR, update Beads status to `draft` (see "Multi-agent workflow" above)
8. Review by the relevant team (see `.github/CODEOWNERS` and CONTRIBUTING.md review ownership table)

## Content rules

- **NEVER reference `dfx`** — it is deprecated. Use icp-cli instead.
- All docs must have complete frontmatter (see CONTRIBUTING.md for schema)
- Synced content must not be edited directly — edits must go to the source repo
- All code examples must be self-contained and copy-pasteable
- Code examples: <30 lines inline, >30 lines link to `dfinity/examples`
- No `.mdx` files. No JSX. Plain markdown only.
- Use relative paths with `.md` extension for internal links (e.g., `[Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md)`). Never use absolute paths like `/getting-started/quickstart/` — they break on GitHub.
- Max sidebar nesting: 3 levels
- Images go in `src/assets/images/` organized by section (see CONTRIBUTING.md for details)
- When writing a page, decide case-by-case whether portal images are worth carrying over. Keep the existing hand-drawn visual style.
- **Motoko standard library:** Always use `core` (`mops.one/core`), never `base`. The `core` library supersedes `base`. Link to the synced base→core migration guide for developers still on `base`.

## Skills

When available, use these skills during docs work:

- **`technical-documentation`** — For drafting and reviewing docs quality
- **icskills** (`npx skills add dfinity/icskills`) — 17 ICP development skills with canister IDs, tested code, and common pitfalls. Use the relevant skill when writing any feature guide.

## Frontmatter schema

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"                           # Required
description: "One-line description"           # Required
sidebar:
  order: 1                                    # Optional: only where reading order matters
icskills: [ckbtc, evm-rpc]                    # Optional: related icskills
---
```

## Portal tracking

The old portal (`dfinity/portal`) is still live during the transition period.
When reviewing portal tracking issues:
- **Ignore:** dfx-only changes, JSX/component changes, release notes, NNS dapp guides
- **Flag for rewrite:** Content updates to topics we cover
- **Evaluate:** New content — does it belong in the new docs?

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Local dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

> **Note:** Validation scripts (`validate`, `generate`, `sync`) were removed during the clean slate. They are preserved on `restructuring-attempt-1` and will be restored when the docs are ready for production.

> **Tech stack note:** Using Astro 6 + Starlight 0.38. The Zod v4 sitemap override from earlier versions has been removed.

## Previous work

Branch `restructuring-attempt-1` preserves the previous attempt with 124 pages, CI workflows, sync scripts, and `DOCS_RESTRUCTURING_PROPOSAL.md`.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs via Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Use `bd dolt push`/`bd dolt pull` for remote sync
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
