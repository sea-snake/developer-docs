<!-- Content Brief -->
Handle the security pitfalls of async inter-canister calls. Cover reentrancy attacks (CallerGuard pattern), the saga pattern for multi-step operations, callback traps and how to handle them, bounded vs unbounded wait (the 2MB response limit), and state rollback on call failure. Explain why inter-canister calls are the #1 source of canister bugs.
