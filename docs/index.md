Build full-stack applications that run entirely onchain -- frontend, backend, and data -- with no cloud dependencies. The Internet Computer (ICP) is a network of independent nodes that provides tamperproof execution, certified storage, and native cross-chain integration.

Your code runs as **canisters**: smart contracts that serve HTTP responses, hold persistent state, sign transactions for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and pay for their own compute so your users never see a gas fee.

## Get started in under 10 minutes

[Start the quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md) to install icp-cli, create a project, and deploy your first canister.

## When to build on ICP

ICP is a strong fit when your application needs:

- **Tamperproof execution** -- code runs exactly as deployed, verifiable by anyone
- **Censorship resistance** -- no single entity can take your app offline
- **No vendor lock-in** -- no cloud account, no API keys, no terms of service changes
- **Cross-chain interop** -- native Bitcoin/Ethereum signing without bridges
- **User-friendly onboarding** -- no wallet or gas fees required for end users

## What makes ICP different

### Chain-key cryptography
Canisters can sign transactions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains using threshold signatures -- no bridges or oracles required. [Learn more](concepts/chain-key-cryptography.md)

### Orthogonal persistence
Canister memory survives across executions and upgrades. No databases, no serialization -- just use variables. [Learn more](concepts/orthogonal-persistence.md)

### Reverse gas model
Users never pay gas. Canisters pay for their own compute, storage, and bandwidth using **cycles**. [Learn more](concepts/reverse-gas-model.md)

### Autonomous execution
Canisters can schedule their own execution with timers -- no external cron jobs, keepers, or off-chain bots. [Learn more](concepts/timers.md)

### Web-native smart contracts
Canisters serve HTTP responses directly. Host full web applications -- frontend and backend -- entirely onchain. [Learn more](concepts/app-architecture.md)

### Chain Fusion
Natively interact with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains from ICP canisters. [Learn more](concepts/chain-fusion.md)
