TODO: Write content for this page.

<!-- Content Brief -->
Deploy canisters with Wasm modules larger than the 2MB limit. Cover the Wasm chunk store for splitting large modules, gzip compression for reducing size, the ic-wasm tool for stripping and optimizing, and Wasm64 support for 64-bit memory. Explain when and why you might need large modules (ML models, complex business logic). Include a section on WebAssembly SIMD — 200+ vector instructions for parallel computation that accelerate AI/ML inference, image processing, cryptographic operations, and other math-heavy workloads. SIMD is available on every ICP node.
